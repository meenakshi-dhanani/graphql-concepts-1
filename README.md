# GraphQL Concepts

## Overview
These cards contain the fundamental building blocks of modern GraphQL APIs. Many of them come from the GraphQL Specification, tagged spec, and the others donâ€™t, tagged non-spec. Breaking down complex technology structures into singular concepts is an important technique for simplifying technology, making it more accessible to a wider audience, and improving communication and collaboration across the technology community.

## Where to find them
All the concept cards are currently hosted at Airtable - https://airtable.com/appHEZBQajKXcPlrg/shr18BuXdjn4AdZIn

## Feedback
The concept cards are a work in progress, and we would love your feedback and contributions. We encourage you to create an issue for any feedback or corrections as well as contributions and ideas.
